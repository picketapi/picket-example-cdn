**To run this example:**

1. Clone the repository

2. Place your publishable key where it says `YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY_HERE` within the following files:
    - public/js-cdn-example.html
    - public/gated-content-simple.html

3. Run `node server.js`. (Note that we're using node just to make serving the static html files easy for you since browser wallets like Metamask don't allow requests from `file://` paths when you're running locally)

4. Go to `localhost:8080` on any browser. Enjoy :)
